# Baseline

Abilities are found by the player and added to their deck of playable cards. They can choose to use, discard or shuffle the ones that are in their hand. Shuffling will return them to the deck for later (but shuffling costs a turn while they are in combat, during platforming this is done freely). Discarding a card will allow that card to spawn elsewhere (usually the original position it was at).
Using the card is mostly the same as discarding it, however, the player gains some benefit from performing the action. Certain cards will shuffle when used, or be consumed.
# Types

## Interact
Allows the player to interact with the world, once per card that is picked up. This can have various implications, from flicking a lever to opening a door. In certain cases a key item may be required to open the doors, which means that a simple interaction is not enough for the door to open.
## Jump
This allows the player to jump, There are a few ideas I am considering here but overall have not decided which. The options for the jump are
- Permanently available (on surfaces that are jumpable)
- Permanently available  with a cooldown
- Consumable card that cycles back into the deck when used
- Consumable card that is consumed on use and cannot be reused.
## Ghost shape / dodge
Using this ability lets you enter a ghostly shape which causes you to be immune to damage for a small amount of time. This can be used during platforming to move across hazards or phase through certain walls, while during combat this can also be used to dodge incoming attacks.
## Invisibility
Sneak around so that enemies cannot detect you, this will not work on all enemies since not all enemies will track the player. The ones that do track can be avoided by doing so. Using invisibility during combat causes your next attack move to deal some additional damage.
## Terraform
This ability lets you grow vines or otherwise terraform different parts of the map. Using this on water can turn it to ice, using it on vines can make them grow. Alternatively you can also use it during combat to root an enemy in place so that they cannot attack.
## Haste
This is not a card, but a status effect that can happen randomly. It allows the player to take a second action for a few turns.
## Gravity
Change gravity for you or others depending on the card used. Increase, decrease or flip are all possible and allow you freedom to explore your options.
## Radar
Causes items to be revealed in a circle around the player. during battle, this causes you to see what ability the enemy will use. Using this card does not use up your turn, otherwise this would be kind of useless.
## Summon
