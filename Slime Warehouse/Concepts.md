## Items
Each item has a few properties, but the only one that is important for gameplay is the shape. This shape defines what amount of slots will be taken up by the item when it is put into the puzzle. Each item could have a value associate with it or simply be based on the amount of slots it occupies. Some items may also be rotated to fit into the puzzle for more points.
