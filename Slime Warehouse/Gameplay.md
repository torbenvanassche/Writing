## Story and Lore
The player is a creature tamer that can control all kinds of different creatures. However, for the purpose of this game and to protect us from expanding too much this is limited to controlling a single type [[Creatures|Creature]], at first this being limited to a [[Creatures#Slime|Slime]]. Later on, either as part of this game or expanding the world further (potentially for future games) we can add other creatures that each provide their own function.
## Item spawner
Randomly spawning items is the first important element of the gameplay loop. These items are generated at random, and each of them is defined with a pre-defined shape. These shapes are then used by the player to puzzle them together into a container.
## Item requests
Equally as random as the item spawner can spawn items, the item requests come in at random intervals during the day. In Addition to that, certain items can only spawn as part of events that are unique and have a unique item associated with that event.
## Puzzle
As each item has a shape associated with it, so does each container that is used to ship the items. The shape of the box is always rectangular but can vary in size. The player has to fit the item they are carrying into the container box, then repeat the process until the box cannot hold more items. Each box has a cost associated with it, each item that is placed into it will grant the player points/money to compensate them for being efficient in the way they fit everything into the boxes. 

> An example is a box with 3x3 dimensions that costs 9 coins, where each filled slot providing 1 coin with an additional reward for filling up all 9 slots. This to encourage people to fill the box as much as possible to optimize their profit.
## Gameplay loop

The objective of the game is to manage the items that are coming into the warehouse, and make sure they are shipped in a timely manner. To do this, the player has to bring the items that have spawned to a packaging machine as described in [Puzzle](#puzzle). The gameplay can be simplified into the following steps:
1. The player looks at the shipment that is requested, and can go grab items that have randomly spawned. They can also choose to have items delivered upon request, albeit costing a small amount of coins. The player can only carry one item at a time at the start of the game, but this has the potential to be upgraded later down the line in the form of upgrades.

2. After the item is collected and added to the inventory, it can be transported to the packaging puzzle where the player can deposit that item. The player will notice that the item has a certain shape associated with it, such that they have to make it fit as effectively as possible. Some items can also be rotated so that they can fit into the container more efficiently.

3. When the player has placed the item into the container, they repeat the process of fetching the requested items for the delivery. These steps can be repeated as long as the container is not full, or they decide it is full enough to proceed with the next step.

4. When a container is closed up and contains items, it can be shipped off. At this point, the container gets closed and can no longer be changed. The player will be notified of the amount of coins they will receive for shipping this order. That money can then be used to buy other/bigger boxes and upgrades that make it easier to meet requirements to turn a profit.
